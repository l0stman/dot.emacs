This is my emacs startup file and some tweaking:
* README: this file.
* install.bat: install the different configurations files under Windows 10.
* install.sh: install the different configurations files on *nix systems.
  It also generates a core file containing the SLIME swank server for SBCL.
* xmodmaprc*: xmodmap files that emulate the Lisp Machine keyboard for various
  machines. They enable Hyper and Super modifiers and also assumes a dvorak
  keyboard.
[Note that Ubuntu doesn't read .Xmodmap at startup so we need to add the
script "loadxkm" to "Startup Applications."]
* dot.emacs: the emacs startup file
* lib: some emacs lisp libraries I use.
* emacs-custom.el:  emacs customization file.
