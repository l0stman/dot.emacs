This is my emacs startup file and some tweaking:
* README: this file.
* install.sh: install the different configurations files.  It also
generates a core file containing the SLIME swank server for SBCL.
* xmodmaprc: emulate the Lisp Machine keyboard enabling Hyper and
Super modifiers.  It assumes a dvorak keyboard.  You should add the
following lines in your .xinitrc:
setxkbmap dvorak
xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
[Note that Ubuntu doesn't read .Xmodmap at startup so we need to add the
script "LoadUserXmap.py" to "Startup Applications."]
* dot.emacs: the emacs startup file
* lib: some emacs lisp libraries I use.
* emacs-custom.el:  emacs customization file.
